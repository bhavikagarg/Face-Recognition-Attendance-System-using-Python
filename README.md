# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-using-Python
Project Description: Automate the process of taking attendance. by identifying Face Recognition. Used face-recognition library to detect and recognize the face. Compare the captured faces with stored images to verify identity. When the face is recognized, mark the attendance in the database with timestamp.
Key Components of Project: 
o	Real time database using Firebase platform for face recognition system, stored the images and information of students in the database.
o	Used Python libraries such as OpenCV to capture images from webcam.
o	NumPy library for multidimensional arrays. Transformed the images into an array as trained model.
o	Pandas, for Data Frames. Strong data structures that allow for efficient data storage and manipulation.
Project Challenges: Linkage of Webcam with cvzone.
